 Setting SIMPLE_LAYOUT to 1 uses a layout that involves less application code and
 produces a layout where the web view content has margins that are relative to
 the imageable area of the paper.
 
 Setting SIMPLE_LAYOUT to 0 uses a layout that involves more computation and setup
 and produces a layout where the webview content is inset 1/2 from the edge of the
 paper (assuming it can be without being clipped). See the comments in
 APLPrintPageRenderer.m immediately after #if !SIMPLE_LAYOUT.
